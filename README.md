## 🔥Stranger Things – Fire Reveal Hero

   -  Fire reveal effect that follows the mouse like a magic torch
   - High-performance animations using useRef (no re-renders)
   - Cinematic mouse tracking with smooth interpolation
   - CSS mask + radial gradients for realistic fire glow
   - Optimized with requestAnimationFrame
